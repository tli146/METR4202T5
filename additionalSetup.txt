Open your terminal
Write the command --> gedit ~/.bashrc
I file will open on gedit
Go to the bottom (my last line was "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" , for others it may differ)
Go under that line and write --> source [YOUR PATH]/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Save and exit
Now with every new shell you open, it will source automatically
